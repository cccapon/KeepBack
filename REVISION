KeepBack Revision History
-------------------------

2011-01-20  1.03
  - changed .keep XML to indent text (make it more human readable).
  - when backup operation was cancelled, any unprocessed folders in the current archive would be moved to the history
    folder inadvertently.  Now fixed.

2010-11-14  1.02
  - disable Explore button for release to SourceForge.

2009-12-12  v1.01
  - fixed bug in history and merging where some filenames have changed case and were not matched with each other.
    - we now detect the case support of the file system automatically.
    - it isn't a very good method, would like to find a better / faster way.

2009-03-28  1.0
  - added Edit interface for managing control files.
  - added New button to create new control file.
  - changed control file extension from .ctrl to .keep

2009-01-13
  - added counter for skipped files
  - the control file is preserved in the dated backup folder now.  Old control files
    will be preserved historically when they change.
  - more cleanup of logged messages
  - added history browser form, has no functional code yet, just a design prototype
  - reorganized the main panel to clean things up a little
  - check for and ignore empty patterns
  - now check for prior history and that history path exists before moving files there

2009-01-05
  - fixed bug in history maintenance, it was trying to delete the old file from history
    rather than current before moving new file in to current.
  - cleaned up log messages and added a status legend to log file
  - control file archive block now identifies separately, root=, folder= and name=
    rather than path=.  This is to facilitate moving the archive location at a later
    date.  When USB drives are plugged in, the drive letter is uncertain each time.
    Same under Linux.  This will be the root= portion.  Folder can also change which
    is the place the archive is located under the root.  Name stays the same and is
    the name of the final directory in which everything is stored.

2009-01-03
  - Log files are now written to the Archive backup directory and have dated names.
    - log files are maintained by the Merge facility the same way that directories
      are merged.  When a folder no longer exists, its log files are removed as well.
    - separate log files on a per-archive basis are created rather than one single log
      file as before.
  - Include, Exclude and History paths are now fully supported.
    - Includes are checked before Excludes.
  - Patterns that end with a directory character only match directories.
  - Patterns that do not end with a directory character only match files.
  - Excluded directories will not be scanned further for deeper Included directories.
  - Included directories include all files and subfolders by default.
    - subfolders can be excluded with an Exclude pattern.
  - debug messages have been added to try to locate where the FileMove failure is occuring.
  - dated backup folder names have been changed to remove the space in them.
  - Patterns now have a Debug option to allow their effect to be traced.
  - the <log> section has been removed from .ctrl files.
