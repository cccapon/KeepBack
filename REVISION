KeepBack Revision History
-------------------------
2016-02-21  2.0.1
  - KeepBack will now remember the window location and size for the main window and the edit window.
  - On the main window, the Info panel colour has been changed to make it more readable.
  - When changing values in the Archive panel of the Edit window, the Save button will now activate.

2016-01-05  2.00
  - Configuration files can now hold information on only one archive.  Previously, Backup Sets contained
    definitions for multiple archives.  This made it difficult to know which archive was being referred to
    when running the log browser or archive explorer.  By restricting configuration files to one archive,
    it makes the operation simpler.
  - Configuration files are now always saved in the Archive folder.  Opening the configuration file thus also
    points to the archive folder.
  - The interface has been rewritten to add some counters to better indicate the progress being made.
  - Multi-threaded.  A scan thread checks for modified files while an update thread writes the changed
    file to the archive.  Hopefully this will make the archive process a bit faster.
  - Log files can be reviewed from within KeepBack from the Tools menu.
  - The cleanup of log files is now separate from the merging of historical archives.  There is a single
    setting indicating the number of days over which to keep log files.
  - Filters have been combined so there is only one list (each filter has a "type" parameter).  The order
    of the filters in the list is the order they will be applied against files being backed up.

2011-08-24  1.04
  - alter interface to show Created, Modified, Deleted.  Removed Changed, Attribute, Written and Length.
  - no longer check attributes as indicator of a changed file.
  - reverse order of History and Exclude filters in Folder panel of Edit window.
  - bug in directory processing with filters.  if an input filter is specified which includes files
    in a folder, but does not specify the folder, then the folder would be moved to history.  later it
    would be copied again, then moved to history leading to a cyclic pattern and the Directory Exists bug.
  - if a folder was added to an archive, but no path was specified then an exception was thrown when
    a backup was run.  this now displays a warning message instead.
  - directory names in the log file now have a '\' appended to the name to distinguish them from files.
  - a date range check is performed on the archive filesystem and used when validating file dates.  if
    the source filesystem allows a greater range of file dates than the destination, the file date will
    be adjusted to match that of the archive file system.  this is to solve a bug where corrupt dates in
    the source filesystem caused files to endlessly be archived (their dates were always different).  it 
    may also help solve the "file exists" bug which was caused when KeepBack attempted to move the history
    file back after a failed copy.  the copy hadn't actually failed, it was the code which sets the file
    date that failed.
  - if a file is moved to a history folder and the latest version of that file can not be copied to the
    archive, no attempt is made to move the history version back to the current archive.  in the past we
    tried to put the file back, which lead to problems like the date range bug above.  now, the archive
    more accurately represents the accessability of the filesystem.
  - added a debug menu option to add extra messages to the log file.
  - add list of wild card characters to pattern screen in edit window.
  - added about box.
  - a bug in the DirectoryDelete operation required the folder to be empty for delete to take place.

2011-01-20  1.03
  - changed .keep XML to indent text (make it more human readable).
  - when backup operation was cancelled, any unprocessed folders in the current archive would be moved to the history
    folder inadvertently.  Now fixed.

2010-11-14  1.02
  - disable Explore button for release to SourceForge.

2009-12-12  v1.01
  - fixed bug in history and merging where some filenames have changed case and were not matched with each other.
    - we now detect the case support of the file system automatically.
    - it isn't a very good method, would like to find a better / faster way.

2009-03-28  1.0
  - added Edit interface for managing control files.
  - added New button to create new control file.
  - changed control file extension from .ctrl to .keep

2009-01-13
  - added counter for skipped files
  - the control file is preserved in the dated backup folder now.  Old control files
    will be preserved historically when they change.
  - more cleanup of logged messages
  - added history browser form, has no functional code yet, just a design prototype
  - reorganized the main panel to clean things up a little
  - check for and ignore empty patterns
  - now check for prior history and that history path exists before moving files there

2009-01-05
  - fixed bug in history maintenance, it was trying to delete the old file from history
    rather than current before moving new file in to current.
  - cleaned up log messages and added a status legend to log file
  - control file archive block now identifies separately, root=, folder= and name=
    rather than path=.  This is to facilitate moving the archive location at a later
    date.  When USB drives are plugged in, the drive letter is uncertain each time.
    Same under Linux.  This will be the root= portion.  Folder can also change which
    is the place the archive is located under the root.  Name stays the same and is
    the name of the final directory in which everything is stored.

2009-01-03
  - Log files are now written to the Archive backup directory and have dated names.
    - log files are maintained by the Merge facility the same way that directories
      are merged.  When a folder no longer exists, its log files are removed as well.
    - separate log files on a per-archive basis are created rather than one single log
      file as before.
  - Include, Exclude and History paths are now fully supported.
    - Includes are checked before Excludes.
  - Patterns that end with a directory character only match directories.
  - Patterns that do not end with a directory character only match files.
  - Excluded directories will not be scanned further for deeper Included directories.
  - Included directories include all files and subfolders by default.
    - subfolders can be excluded with an Exclude pattern.
  - debug messages have been added to try to locate where the FileMove failure is occuring.
  - dated backup folder names have been changed to remove the space in them.
  - Patterns now have a Debug option to allow their effect to be traced.
  - the <log> section has been removed from .ctrl files.
